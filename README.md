# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create an inclusive and filterable table on a website for Dana to utilize as a resource for her upcoming project. She wants to write about UFO sightings and this table will allow her to filter based on date, location, appearance, and other factors to identify trends for her writing assignmenrt.

## Results
In order to utilize the table created on our website, one could scroll through the table to find the data they are looking for, but there are a lot of data and it would be quite time-consuming to do so. Instead, to make things easier and more accessible, we've created the ability to filter the table of UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Simply type your criterion into one of the boxes and hit Enter to see filtered results. 

In the example below, I was able to enter that I wanted to only see UFO sightings in Tennessee, the state where I live, so I typed "tn" in the search box for state and hit Enter. Voila! Just one UFO sighting in my state out of that massive table - it would have taken me forever to scroll through and find that!

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that it is case-sensitive, so if you accidentally put "OR" to search for Oregon, for example, it will show zero results. If you instead enter "or," however, it will bring up three results. In the future, as this website is further developed, I would like to see two design elements added. For one, I would like to see a search filter for duration of the UFO sighting - the information is already found in the table, we just need a way to search for it. Secondly, I'd like to see a photo element added for any entries to which that applies. Some of the listings in the table reference a photo and I think it would be a helpful element for users to be able to view.
