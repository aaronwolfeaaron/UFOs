# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create an inclusive and filterable table on a website for Dana to utilize as a resource for her upcoming project. She wants to write about UFO sightings and this table will allow her to filter based on date, location, appearance, and other factors to identify trends for her writing assignmenrt.

## Results
In order to utilize the table created on our website, one could scroll through the table to find the data they are looking for, but there are a lot of data and it would be quite time-consuming to do so. Instead, to make things easier and more accessible, we've created the ability to filter the table of UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Simply type your criterion into one of the boxes and hit Enter to see filtered results. 

In the example below, I was able to enter that I wanted to only see UFO sightings in Tennessee, the state where I live, so I typed "tn" in the search box for state and hit Enter. Voila! Just one UFO sighting in my state out of that massive table - it would have taken me forever to scroll through and find that!
